**Description:**

This app was created for the shopify frontend intern coding challenge. The app allows you to search the [**OMDB API**](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and nominate your top 5 movies for the illustrious "Shoppies" award.
- App was depoyed and hosted on Netlify 
- This app was built with React using [**Styled Components**](https://styled-components.com/)

**Favourite Features:**
- This app is fully responsive and works on mobile. 
- Cards use a "parrallax" hover effect adapted from [**Daniel Sinclair's Repo**](https://github.com/DanielSinclair/react-atv-parallax)
- The custom Shoppies logo designed by me!


**How I Failed Forward:**
- I initially had a lot of challenges getting the website to be fully responsive. The containers were resizing in all kinds of funny ways! I had to do a lot of googling, and experimenting until I finally figured it out! 
- The parallax effect did not work right away. I had to do a little bit of tweaking (remove some of the layering effect), and design changes (add onClick to the div) to get it to work properly. 

**What I Learned:**
- I learned how to use media queries in React components to implement the responsive movie cards.
- I learned how to deploy a website using netlify. 
- I learned how to work with an API and best practices for storing my API Key when uploading to a public repository.
